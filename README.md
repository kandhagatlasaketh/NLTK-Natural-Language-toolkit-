Natural Language Processing using NLTK
*Project Overview

This project demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python. The goal is to preprocess, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from textual data using standard NLP workflows.

*Objectives
Understand and preprocess raw text data
Perform tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
Remove stopwords and noise from text
Analyze text patterns and word frequencies
Prepare text data for downstream machine learning models

* Tools & Technologies Used
Python
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

*Dataset Description
Text-based dataset (reviews, sentences, or documents)
Contains unstructured textual data
Source: (Mention source such as Kaggle / CSV / text files if applicable)

* NLP Techniques Implemented

1️⃣ Text Preprocessing
Lowercasing text
Removing punctuation and special characters
Removing stopwords

2️⃣ Tokenization
Sentence tokenization
Word tokenization

3️⃣ Stemming & Lemmatization
Porter Stemmer
WordNet Lemmatizer

4️⃣ Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
Identified grammatical structure of sentences

5️⃣ Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Extracted entities such as names, locations, and organizations

6️⃣ Text Analysis
Word frequency distribution
N-grams (unigrams, bigrams)

*Key Insights

Identified frequently occurring words and phrases
Improved text quality through preprocessing
Extracted meaningful linguistic features from raw text
